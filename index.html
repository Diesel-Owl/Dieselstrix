    <h2>The Journey</h2>

    <p>For the last 12 years, I’ve worked in law enforcement. It’s a job that requires discipline, responsibility, and a steady mind. But somewhere along the way, I realized I had stopped doing things for myself. I was surviving, not living.</p>

    <p><strong>DieselStrix is my turning point.</strong></p>

    <p>This project is about building something with my own hands that reminds me — and hopefully others — that your dreams don’t expire just because life got heavy.</p>

    <h3>What is DieselStrix?</h3>
    <p>DieselStrix is a custom STOL backcountry aircraft that I am building myself. Not purchased. Built.</p>
    <p>It’s a hybrid design using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CH-750 cabin and main wings for rugged short takeoff capability</li>
        <li>CH-650 tail for clean control and stability in cruise</li>
        <li>Powered by a Cummins diesel engine for reliability and efficiency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This plane isn’t just a machine. It’s a statement:</p>
    <p><strong>We are allowed to build our lives differently.</strong></p>

    <h3>Why I’m Asking for Support</h3>
    <p>I’m working to earn my Private Pilot License and build DieselStrix from the ground up. Every step of this journey will be documented — the training, the build progress, the challenges, and the breakthroughs.</p>
    <p>The goal isn’t just to fly.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal is to show others that you can start your dream from exactly where you are.</strong></p>
    <p>No perfect timing. No waiting for later. Just one step at a time.</p>

    <h3>What the Funds Will Help With</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flight training & PPL certification</li>
        <li>Airframe materials and build components</li>
        <li>Safety inspections & FAA compliance</li>
        <li>Documenting the journey so others can follow and learn</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Be Part of DieselStrix</h3>
    <p>This isn’t a one-man project.</p>
    <p>Everyone who contributes — no matter the amount — becomes part of the build.</p>
    <p>Everyone who supports this build becomes part of DieselStrix in a very real way.</p>

    <p>I’ll be creating the DieselStrix Supporter Binder — a physical album that stays with the aircraft for its entire life. Each supporter will have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your photo</li>
        <li>The dream you’re chasing, too</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When DieselStrix stands on her own gear for the first time, supporters will be invited to take a picture next to the plane, and that photo will be added to your page in the binder.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just my dream.</p>
    <p>This is a record of every person who chose to keep dreaming — and helped make DieselStrix real.</p>

    <p>No gimmicks. No empty hype.</p>
    <p>Just real work, done step by step, honored by the people who believed in it.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Closing</h3>
    <p>I’m not running away from my life. I’m building the next chapter of it.</p>
    <p>If DieselStrix inspires even one person to pick their dream back up — that’s enough.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you for being part of this.</strong></p>
